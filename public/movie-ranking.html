<h1>My Favourite movies of all time</h1>
<h2>My top three Favourite movies</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Joker</h3>
<p>I love the acting and the plot behind the Joker, It really had a relatable feeling to it</p>

<h3>Suzume no Tojimari</h3>
<p>Well no much needs to be said, The graphics, plot and another beautiful masterpiece by Makoto Shinkai</p>

<h3>Spider-Man:Across the spider verse</h3>
<p>I never thought a Marvel movie could keep me at the edge of my sit after Endgame but they showed they are back in business and this movie proved it, beautiful</p>
